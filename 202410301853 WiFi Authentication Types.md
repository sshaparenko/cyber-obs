**WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** The original WiFi security protocol, WEP, provides basic encryption but is now considered outdated and insecure due to vulnerabilities that make it easy to breach

**WPA (WiFi Protected Access):** Introduced as an interim improvement over WEB, WPA offers better encryption through TKIP (Temporary Key Integrity Protocol), but it is still less secure than newer standards

**WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access II):** A significant advancement over WPA, WPA2 uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for robust security. It has been the standard for many years providing strong protection for most networks.

**WPA3 (WiFi Protected Access III):** The latest standard, WPA3, enhances security with features like individualized data encryption and more robust password-based authentication, making it the most secure option currently available
