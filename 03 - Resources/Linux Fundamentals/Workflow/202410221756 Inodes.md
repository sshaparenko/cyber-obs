In Linux, file metadata (file size, permissions, timestamps and inode number) is stored in **inodes**.

Each file has an associated inode.

##### The `ls` command and inodes
***
When you run the `ls` command:
- it lookups the directory to find the mapping between file names and inode numbers
- Uses the inode to fetch the fileâ€™s metadata
- Displays this metadata in the output

### `ls -i` can show you the inode number of a file
