**NFS (Network File System)** is a network protocol that allows us to store and manage files on remote systems as if they were stored on local systems.

For Linux, there are several NFS servers:
- NFS-UTILS (Ubuntu)
- NFS-Ganesha (Solaris)
- OpenNFS (Redhat Linux)

We can configure NFS via configuration file `/etc/exports`. Here you can configure:
- which directories should be shared
- access rights for the users and systems
- transfer speed
- use of encryption

Here are some important access right that can be configured in NFS:

| Permissions    | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rw             | Gives users and systems rw permission to the shared dir                                                                                                  |
| ro             | Gives users and systems read-only access to the shared directory                                                                                         |
| no_root_squash | Prevents the root user on the client form being restricted to the right of a normal user                                                                 |
| root_squash    | Restricts the rights of the root on the client to the rights of a normal user                                                                            |
| sync           | Synchronizes the transfer of data to ensure that changes are only transferred after they have been saved on the file system                              |
| async          | Transfers data asynchronously which makes the transfer faster, but may cause inconsistencies in the file system if changes have not been fully committed |

## Create NFS Share
***

To create a new folder and share it temporarily in NFS, we can do the follows:

```bash
$ mkdir test
$ echo '/home/user/test hostname(rw, sync, no_root_squash)' >> /etc/exports
$ cat /etc/exports | grep -v "#"
/home/user/test hostname(rw, sync, no_root_squash)
```

## Mount NFS Share
***

If we’ve created an NFS share and want to work with it on the target system, we have to mount it first

```bash
$ mkdir ~/target_nfs
$ mount 10.129.12.17:/home/john/dev_scripts ~/target_nfs
$ tree ~/target_nfs

target_nfs/
├── css.css
├── html.html
├── javascript.js
├── php.php
└── xml.xml

0 directories, 5 files
```

Now, we mount an NFS share “dev_scripts“ from target 10.129.12.17 into our mounting point “target_nfs“
