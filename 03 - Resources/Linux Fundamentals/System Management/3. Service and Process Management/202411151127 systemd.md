`systemd` is a modern **init system** and service manager for Linux. It manages the startup sequence, services and processes during boot and while the system is running

It replaces older systems like [[SysV]] and Upstart

Configuration files (**unit files**) are the key components of `systemd`. They define how `systemd` manages services, sockets, mounts and other system components

`/etc/systemd/system/name.service`

### with `systemctl enable`, we can configure a service to start automatically on system boot

## to examine a problems, that may occur on system boot, use `journalctl` to view logs
