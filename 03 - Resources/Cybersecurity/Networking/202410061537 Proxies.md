#### Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy
***
In a corporate network, sensitive computers may not have direct access to the Internet. To access a website, they must go through a proxy (or web filter). 

This can be an incredibly powerful line of defense against malware, as not only does it need to bypass the web filter (which is easy) but it would also need to be proxy aware or use a non-traditional [[202410061527 Command and Control Infrastructure (C2 C&C)|C2]] (a way for malware to receive tasking information). 

If the organization only utilizes Firefox, the likelihood of getting proxy-aware malware is improbable.

Web Browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome all obey the “System Proxy“ settings by default. If the malware utilizes `WinSock` (Native Windows API), it will likely be proxy aware without any additional code. Firefox does not use `WinSock` and instead uses `libcurl`, which enables it to use the same code on any operating system. This means that the malware would need to look for Firefox and pull the proxy settings, which malware is highly unlikely to do.

Alternatively, malware could use DNS as a [[202410061527 Command and Control Infrastructure (C2 C&C)|C2]] mechanism. But if an organization is monitoring DNS (which is easily done using [Sysmon](https://medium.com/falconforce/sysmon-11-dns-improvements-and-filedelete-events-7a74f17ca842)), this type of traffic should get caught quickly.

#### Reverse Proxy
***
A Reverse Proxy is the reverse of a Forward Proxy. Instead of being designed to filter outgoing requests, it filters incoming ones.

The most common goal with a Reverse Proxy is to listen on an address and forward it to a closed-off network.

### Many organizations use CloudFlare as they have a robust network that can withstand most DDOS Attacks.

> Penetration testers will configure reverse proxies on the infected endpoints. The infected endpoint endpoint will listen on a port and send any client that connects to the port back to the attacker. 
> 
> This is useful to bypass firewalls or evade logging. Organisations may have IDS (Intrusion Detection System), watching external web requests. If the attacker gains access to the organization over SSH, a reverse proxy can send web requests through SSH Tunnel and evade the IDS.

Another common Reverse Proxy is **ModSecurity**, a [[Web Application Firewall]]. WAFs inspect web requests for malicious content and block the request if it is malicious.

#### (Non-) Transparent Proxy
***
All these proxy services act either `transparently` or `non-transparently`

With `transparent proxy`, the client doesn’t know about its existence. The transparent proxy intercepts the client’s communication requests to the Internet and acts as substitute instance. To the outside, the `transparent proxy`, like `non-transparent`, acts as a communication partner

If it’s a `non-transparent` proxy, we must be informed about its existence. For this purpose, we and the software we want to use are given a special proxy configuration that ensures that traffic to the Internet is first addressed to the proxy.

If this configuration doesn’t exist, we cannot communicate with the proxy.
