**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is a standard communication protocol used to transfer files from a server to a client on a computer network.

FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, generally in the form of a username and password. 

#### However, they can connect anonymously if the server allow it

For secure transmissions that protects the username and password and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaces with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
