**SPF Record** - sender policy framework record is a type of [[DNS TXT]] record that lists all the servers authorized to send emails from a particular domain. 

(**!**) **SPF records were created because SMTP does not inherently authenticate the “from“ address in an email. This means that without SPF, an attacker can easily impersonate a sender and trick the recipient into taking action or sharing information they  otherwise would not** 

> If SPF record does not have a sender’s IP address or domain on its list the receiver server will either not deliver those emails, or mark them as spam
