#### What is an SQLi
***
SQLi is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

#### What is an impact of SQLi
***
A successful SQLi attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:
- Passwords
- Credit card details
- Personal user information

SQLi attack have been used in many high-profile data breaches over the years. These have caused reputational damage and regulatory fines. 

In some cases an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into a system, leading to a long term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period

#### How to detect
***
You can detect SQLi manually using a systematic set of tests against every point in the application:

- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value and look for systematic differences in the application responses
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2` and look for differences in the applicationâ€™s responses
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond
- [[OAST]] payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query and monitor any resulting interactions

#### SQLi in different parts of the query
***
Most SQLi occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. 

However, SQLi can also occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQLi arises are:

- in `UPDATE` within the updated values or `WHERE` clause
- in `INSERT` within the inserted values
- in `SELECT` within the table or column name
- in `SELECT` within the `ORDER BY` clause
