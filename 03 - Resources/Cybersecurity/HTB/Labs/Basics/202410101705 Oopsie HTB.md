#### Terminology
***
- **web crawler (web spider / web robot)** - is a program or automated script which browsers the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. This process is called Web crawling or spidering. Many legitimate sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data.

- **Burp Suite** - 
- SUID (Set Owner User ID)

- `gobuster` - a tool used to brute-force: URIs (directories and files) in web sites, DNS subdomains (with [[wildcard]] support), Virtual Host names on target web sites, Open Amazon S3 buckets, Open Google Could buckets and [[TFTP]] servers

#### Steps
***

First, we need to access website `http://{ip_address}`. Here we can see the main page and that in order to access it, we need to login.

To search for a PATH to login page, we will use **web crawler** called **Burp Suite.** 

We can start it by running a command `burpsuite`

In Burp Suite itself we should set `Proxy` to `Intercept off`. 

This allows traffic to pass through the web crawler without pausing for modifying it. Burp Suite will still capture data but wont pause it for manual inspection or modification.

In browser setting we should set proxy to send traffic to Burp Suite.

Now, when we’ll send request to the website, Burp Suite will get the traffic and list files.

Here we can see, that we can access login page through path `/cdn-cgi/login`. This will lead us to the login page where we can login as `Guest`.

Under the `Account` menu we can access account information. We can try to enumerate users by changing `id` parameter in url. When we change `?id=1` we will access administrator account information.

Here we can get Access ID and set it to the cookie, go get access to `Uploads` page. 

Now we will try to exploit system by running a reverse shell. For this purpose, we’ll use php script called `php-reverse-shell.php` it’s located under `usr/share/webshells/php` directory.
##### it’s important to change ip address and port number in the script itself

Before uploading the script, we should start `netcat`

```bash
sudo nc -lnvp 1234
```

Now we can upload the script at the upload section

To know what directory can be used to store uploaded script, we can use the tool called `gobuster` with the next command

```bash
gobuster dir --url http://{target_ip}/ --wordlist /usr/share/wordlist/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php
```

> `gobuster dir` - `dir` specifies the mode of Gobuster should run in. In this case, it’s directory brute-forcing mode, which attempts to discover directories or files on the specified web server

> `--url` - specifies the target url 

> `--wordlist` - specifies path to the wordlist Gobuster will use to brute force directory and file names. It contains a list of commonly used directory and file names
> `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt` - path to the wordlist

> `-x` specifies the file extension the Gobuster should append to the file names in the wordlist, in this case `php`

This will return the next response:

Here we can see the `/uploads` directory, where our reverse shell can be stored.

By accessing web site via `/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php` we’ll execute the script file and should gain access over the server

```bash
find / -group <name> 2>/dev/null
```
