### Inter-Disciplinary Assessments
***

Some Assessments may require involvement from the people with diverse skillsets that complement one another. While logically more complex, these tend to organically be more collaborative in nature between the consulting team and the client

#### Purple Team Assessment
***

AS the name implies, this is a combined effort between the blue and red teams. Most commonly a penetration tester and incident responder. The general concept is that pentester simulates a give threat , and the incident responder works with the internal blue team to review their existing toolset to determine whether alerting is properly configured

#### Cloud Focused Pentest
***

While heavily overlapping with a conventional pentest, an assessment wit ha cloud focus will benefit from the knowledge of someone with a background in cloud architecture and administration.

It can often be as simple as helping to articulate to the pentester what is possible to abuse with a particular piece of information that was discovered.

#### Comprehensive IoT Testing
***

IoT platforms typically have three major components: network, cloud and application. There are folks who are very specialized in each one of these that will be able to provide a mush more thorough assessment together rather than relying on one person with only basic knowledge in each area.

Another component taht may need to be tested is the hardware layer, which is covered below.

### Web Application Penetration Testing
***

Depending on the scope, this type of assessment may also be considered an inter-disciplinary assessment. Some application assessment may only focus on identifying and validating the vulnerabilities in an application with role-based, authenticated testing with no interest in evaluating the underlying server. 

Others may want to test both the application and the infrastructure with the intent of initial compromise being through the web application itself.

### Hardware Pentest
***

This type of testing is often done on IoT-type devices but can be extended to testing the physical security of a laptop shipped by the client or an onsite kiosk or ATM. Each client will have a different comfort level with the depth of testing here, so it's vital to establish the rules of engagement before the assessment begins, particularly when it comes to destructive testing.
