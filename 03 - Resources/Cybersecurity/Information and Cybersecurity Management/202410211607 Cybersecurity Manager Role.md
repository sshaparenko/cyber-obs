#### Who is a Cybersecurity Manager
***
**Cybersecurity managers** or **Chief Information Security Officers** (CISO) are responsible for managing the cybersecurity of an organization.

They lead a team of IT professionals who work to protect the company from cyber threads and attacks. 

CISO specialize in cybersecurity protection, detection, response, and recovery. 

#### CISO’s functions
***
**Policy Compliance:** ensure that your vendors and employees work within the framework of a policy and security program you’ve laid out for them as a manager and overseeing if there are projects with pen-testing, if there are projects with vulnerability assessments, if there’s user awareness training. You want to ensure the visibility of the programs and projects you’re running and hold people accountable

**Monitoring:** Your daily routine must involve going through alerts and logs to monitor your organization digital security footprint.

**Building the relationships:** Relationship building is a significant security manager component. You need to ensure you’re getting feedback from your stakeholders, those teams, the back office, legal, HR or the front office, people in sales or doing the actual work making money for the company

**Reduce Risk:** Managers work across the aisle of departments in the organization to get everyone on the same page, from technical controls to policies and everything in between

**Implement technology:** Suppose your company is looking at a new technology. You, as CISO, will evaluate it and help implement any controls that might mitigate the risk of its operation.

**Align with the company:** as CISO, you must ensure that your security strategy is aligned with the strategy of your company. Also, you should look for tactical initiatives and develop a documented plan of action to put into place if a security incident does occur.

#### STS model
***
It’s always a good idea to have some framework, model or best practice to focus on. 

The Security, Trust and Stability (or STS) model could be an option

- Security: this is where you align cybersecurity frameworks or projects to the business. Make sure there is an alignment. You do not want to do security for the security’s sake
- Trust: this is where you’re meeting your legal requirements and stakeholders; it’s where communication and writing skills are.
- Stability: the stability is by keeping the lights on, ensuring things work and incident response your’re up and running quickly with business continuity

#### Cybersecurity Managers Types
***
**CISO:** The Chief Information Security Officer is the overall executive in IS. This is the most recognized and discussed role. Getting the right fit for the CISO role sets the tone for the organization’s entire security strategy

**TISO:** The Technical Information Security Officer role can have many titles. Still it’ll generally be responsible for technical security controls and network security operations

**SISO:** The Strategic Information Security Officer translates high-level business requirements into enterprise security initiatives and programs that must be implemented to achieve the organization’s mission, goals and objectives.

**BISO:** The Business Information Security Officer blends business and security insight to align the best information security strategy, policies and operations to customer-facing business activities

#### Cybersecurity Strategy vs Management
***
**Cybersecurity strategy** involves creating a multi-year plan to meet industry standards; improve data protection and foster a strong cybersecurity culture within the organization

**Cybersecurity management** includes carrying out regular security audits, monitoring network traffic for any suspicious activity, fixing software vulnerabilities and coordinating responses to cybersecurity incidents

In essence, <u>cybersecurity strategy</u> sets the overarching direction and objectives for an organization’s cybersecurity efforts while <u>cybersecurity management</u> is responsible for putting strategy into action to safeguard the organization
