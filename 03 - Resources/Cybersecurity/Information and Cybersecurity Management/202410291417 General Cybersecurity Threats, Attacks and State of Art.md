#### What is a cyberattack?
***
A cyberattack is a well-defined, advanced, targeted attack that is stealthy and has a mission that it will not stop attempting to achieve until it’s identified and mitigated or succeeds.

Although some attacks are made at random with no particular target in mind. There are also targeted attacks against recipients who have been researched and identified as useful by attackers

**Targeted cyberattack:** for example, phishing attacks are often directed toward recipients with access to data or systems to which the attacker wishes to gain access

**Non-targeted cyberattack:** for example, malware is deployed in widespread attacks with the hope that it will hit as many vulnerable systems as possible

#### Threat Agents
***
**Threat Agents** or actors are anyone who has the potential to impact security. They are either a key driver of or participates in a malicious action that targets an organization’s IT security

There are many types of attackers but the most common are:

1. **Corporations:** they have been known to breach security boundaries and perform malicious acts to gain a competitive advantage
2. **Nation States:** they often target government and private entities with a high level of sophistication to obtain intelligence or carry out other destructive activities
3. **Hacktivists:** they often act independently, being politically motivated but may target specific individuals or organizations to achieve various ideological ends.
4. **Cybercriminals:** they are motivated by the desire of profit, these individuals are involved in fraudulent financial transactions
5. **Cyberwarriors:** they are nationally motivated citizens who may act on behalf of a political party or against another party that threatens them
6. **Script Kiddies:** they are young individuals learning to hack; they may work alone or with others and are primarily involved in code injections and DDoS attacks
7. **Social Hackers:** skilled in social engineering, these hackers are frequently involved in cyberbullying, identity theft and collecting other confidential information or credentials

#### Attack Attributes
***
From the attacker point of view, the <u>asset</u> is a target and the path or rote used to gain access to this asset is known as <u>attack vector</u>

There are two types of attack vectors to consider:
- **Ingress:** intrusion into systems through the boundary of network
- **Egress:** data exfiltration to remove data from systems or networks

Each attack attribute provides unique points where controls can be placed to prevent or detect the attack. So it’s crucial to understand each of them when analyzing and investigating an actual attack:
	`For example, the payload used to deliver the exploit often leaves artifacts or evidence that technical analysts and investigators can use to understand the attack and potentially identify the perpetrators. Analysis of the data exfiltration path may identify additional opportunities to prevent or detect the removal of data or obtain evidence, even if the attack could gain access to the asset`


There are two broad categories for threat events:
1. **An adversarial** threat event is caused by a human threat agent or adversary
2. **A nonadversarial** threat events results from an error, malfunction or mishap

#### Attack Process
***
1. **Perform Reconnaissance:** The adversary gathers information using a variety of techniques, which may include:
	- Sniffing or scanning the network perimeter
	- Using the open-source discovery of org information
	- Running malware or identify potential targets

2. **Create Attack Tools**: The adversary crafts the tools needed to carry out the future attack, which may include:
	- Phishing or spear phishing attack
	- Crafting counterfeit websites or certificates
	- Creating and operating false front organizations components into the supply chain

3. **Deliver Malicious Capabilities:** The adversary inserts or installs whatever is needed to carry out the attack, which may include the following tactics:
	- Introducing malware into organizational information systems
	- Placing subverted individuals into privileged positions within the organization
	- Installing sniffers or scanning devices on targeted networks and systems
	- Inserting tampered hardware or critical components into organizational systems or supply chains

4. **Exploit and Compromise**: the adversary takes advantage of information systems to compromise them, which may involve the following actions:
	- Split tunneling or gaining physical access to org facilities
	- Exfiltrating data or sensitive information
	- Exploiting multitenancy in cloud environment
	- Launching zero-day exploits

5. **Conduct and Attack**
