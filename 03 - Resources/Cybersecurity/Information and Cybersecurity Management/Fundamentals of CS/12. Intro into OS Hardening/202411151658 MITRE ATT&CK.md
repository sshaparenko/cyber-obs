MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge) framework is a comprehensive knowledge base used to describe and analyze adversary behavior in cybersecurity.

It provides a detailed matrix or real-world tactics and techniques used by cyber attackers to compromise systems.

### Key components of MITRE ATT&CK
***

| Component      | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tactics**    | - Represent the goals or objectives of an attacker during an intrusion (e.g., Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation) |
| Techniques     | - Specific methods attackers use to achieve their tactics (e.g., Spearphishing, Credential Dumping)                              |
| Sub-techniques | - More granular methods tied to a parent technique *(e.g., Spearphishing Link under Spearphishing)*                              |
| Procedures     | - Real-world examples of how adversaries implement techniques *(e.g., a specific malware using process injection for evasion)*   |
| Groups         | - Known threat actors and the techniques they commonly use                                                                       |
| Software       | - Tools and malware used by adversaries                                                                                          |

### ATT&CK Matrices
***

The framework includes matrices for specific environments:

1. **Enterprise ATT&CK:** focuses on IT environments like Windows, macOS, Linux, Cloud and containers
2. **Mobile ATT&CK:** focuses on techniques for mobile platforms
3. **ICS ATT&CK:** focuses on techniques targeting Industrial Control Systems
