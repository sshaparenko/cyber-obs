#### Introduction to Nmap
***
Network Mapper (Nmap) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool. 

Itâ€™s used to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, services and applications including the name and version where possible. It can also identify the OS and versions of these hosts.

Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed

#### Use Cases
***
- Audit the security aspects of networks
- Simulate penetration tests
- Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
- Types of possible connections
- Network mapping
- Response analysis
- Identify open ports
- Vulnerability assessment as well

#### Nmap Architecture
***
Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:
- Host discovery
- Port Scanning
- Service enumeration and detection
- OS detection
- Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)

#### Syntax
***
```bash
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

#### Scan Techniques
***
To see all the scanning techniques available, you can run `nmap --help`
