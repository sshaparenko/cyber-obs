#### DNS Enumeration
***
DNS Enumeration is the process of gathering detailed information about a target domainâ€™s DNS records and structure. 

The primary goal is to extract as much as possible about the DNS infrastructure associated with a domain

**Key techniques:**
1. <u>Zone Transfers(AXFR):</u> Attempting to retrieve the entire DNS zone file which contains all DNS records for a domain.
2. <u>DNS Record Lookups:</u> Querying a specific type of DNS Records such as:
	1. [[A record]]
	2. [[MX records]]
	3. [[CNAME records]]
	4. [[DNS TXT]]
3. <u>Brute-forcing Subdomains</u>: Attempting to guess subdomains using a list of common names
4. <u>Reverse DNS Lookups</u>: Discovering domain names associated with a specific IP address

Here is an example of `dnsenum` enumeration

```bash
dnsenum fuib.com

acg.fuib.com.                 3600     IN    A        194.44.66.6              
autodiscover.fuib.com.        3483     IN    A        194.44.66.146
ext.fuib.com.                 3600     IN    A        194.44.66.6
ftp.fuib.com.                 3600     IN    CNAME    eftp-001.fuib.com.
eftp-001.fuib.com.            3600     IN    A        194.44.66.54
ftps.fuib.com.                3600     IN    A        194.44.66.60
mail.fuib.com.                3600     IN    A        194.44.66.48
mail.fuib.com.                3600     IN    A        194.44.66.47
news.fuib.com.                3600     IN    A        194.44.66.39
ns.fuib.com.                  2316     IN    A        194.44.66.49
ns2.fuib.com.                 2316     IN    A        194.44.66.50
owa.fuib.com.                 3600     IN    A        194.44.66.146
projects.fuib.com.            3600     IN    CNAME    prj-002-vs.fuib.com.
prj-002-vs.fuib.com.          3600     IN    A        10.55.25.99

#### Virtual Host Enumeration
***
**Goal:** enumerate possible old subdomains with removed A record; internal subdomains

In case, if a subdomain is internal (not accessible through Internet), we can try to find it by creating a HOST header with a wordlist

Here is an example of vhost enumeration with `gobuster`. See [[202410211459 Gobuster enumeration|Gobuster enumeration]] for more info

```bash
#!/bin/bash

target='http://89.184.67.44'
base_domain='fuib.com'
wordlist='./subdomains-top1million-5000.txt'

gobuster vhost -k --domain $base_domain --append-domain -u $target -w $wordlist -z
```
