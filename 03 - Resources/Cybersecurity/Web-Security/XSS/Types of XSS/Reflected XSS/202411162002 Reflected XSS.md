Reflected XXS arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way

Suppose the next request

```
https://example.com/search?term=gift
```

Renders a page, with the element:

```html
<p>You searched for: gift</p>
```

Assuming the application doesn’t perform any other processing of data, the attacker can create an attack like this:

```
https://example.com/search?term=<script>alert()</script>
```

In this case, JS script will be executed on the client’s side. The one thing, that needs to be done is to user click on this url.

In place of simple `alert()` can be anything that could steal user’s data.

### Impact of reflected XSS
***

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim’s browser, then he can fully compromise the user:

- Perform any action within the application that the user can perform
- View any information that the user is able to view
- Modify any information that the user is able to modify
- Initiate interactions with other app users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user
